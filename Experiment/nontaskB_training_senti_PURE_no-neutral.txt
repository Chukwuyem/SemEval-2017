1	-1	639142132817641472	nintendo	positive	@DanteReborn I honestly think the Super Mario Bros 2 set is coming.  Nintendo wanted to concentrate development on the more-similar sets 1st

2	-1	639798156079665154	nintendo	positive	On 2nd thought, the NX rumors don't completely make sense because Nintendo is already planning smartphone games
2	-1	639921099166339072	nintendo	positive	@jrconway3 @BitnerdGX Sure, it may not be in a direct sense. But Nintendo gives GX the support by sending them coverage and press releases.
1	-1	640012708411129856	nintendo	negative	I admit Nintendo may have gone a bit overboard with the whole "lets give all the popular youtubers a copy of super mario maker" thing

2	-2	640451835057143808	nintendo	positive	Honestly, lack of 3rd party support should have been expected. its not the company's fault for not siding with Nintendo
2	-1	640523838321725444	nintendo	positive	@ZeroSHEARER @ZhugeEX again an improvement. I don't like barely any Nintendo first party exclusives. It's ALL about 3rd party on all systems
2	-3	640624064198017024	nintendo	positive	@THEREALRTU but then I suppose the 3rd party ports suffer ,maybe Nintendo will use nvidia for there gfx chip... Lol
1	-1	640688164588363776	nintendo	positive	@16KTS @Flareonys Nintendo needs some more 3rd party reps, but at the same time that's what makes them pure.

1	-1	641268636410380288	nintendo	positive	@BlazeRuler Nintendo may have wanted to make it E10+, so they left him out. I dunno, probably not true
2	-1	641295492492738560	nintendo	positive	@JediPrince84 I bought Rayman Legends just to have some simple fun. I can't wait for Nintendo to sink and become a 2nd/3rd party developer
1	-1	641296016788996096	nintendo	positive	It would be poetic if Nintendo became a Sony 2nd Party Developer. It would also make choosing consoles every generation very easy
1	-1	641296390883291136	nintendo	positive	Apparently Super Mario Maker comes out on the 11th of September. I guess it's Nintendo's way of saying "just bloody rebuild them already".
